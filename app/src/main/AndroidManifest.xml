<!-- The "package" attribute is rewritten by the Gradle build with the value of applicationId.
     It is still required here, as it is used to derive paths, for instance when referring
     to an Activity by ".MyActivity" instead of the full name. If more Activities are added to the
     application, the package attribute will need to reflect the correct path in order to use
     the abbreviated format.
     The application ID is fixed during development to avoid having to clean app data between debug
     and release builds, which would normally be required. -->
